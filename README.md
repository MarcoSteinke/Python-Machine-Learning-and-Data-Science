# Python-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
This is a repository where i try to get into Data Science and Machine Learning using Python (NumPy, SciPy)

## 1 Data Science Basics

The basics consist of statistical method such as the Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation.

## 2 Generation of Big Data

### 2.1 Data Sets
In this chapter I tried to generate some sets of Data
to learn with. In the following examples I will also try
to generate User Information and analyse it.

### 2.2 Plotting: Histogram
After the generation of Data Sets i started to plot them.
First I let PyPlot count the occurences of the certain
values and plot them in a Histogram.

You will find a picture here:
